# 🏠 House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various factors such as location, number of rooms, square footage, and other features. By leveraging Machine Learning techniques, we can provide accurate price estimations.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Square footage
- Location
- Year built
- House condition
- Additional features (e.g., garage, garden, pool)

## 📌 Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection** – Load and explore the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualize relationships and trends.
4. **Feature Engineering** – Select relevant features for better predictions.
5. **Model Selection & Training** – Train regression models like:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
6. **Model Evaluation** – Use performance metrics such as RMSE, R² score.
7. **Deployment** – Deploy as a web application using Flask.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
